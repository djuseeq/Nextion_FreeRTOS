# Nextion_FreeRTOS
Library for using the Nextion display with FreeRTOS + HAL, mainly for my learning purpose and for fun.
It works, but it can contain bugs, incomplete codes, and inefficient solutions. 
I do not take responsibility for it. All helpful intentions are welcome

I'm trying to get familiar with FreeRTOS and STM32 MCU-s
